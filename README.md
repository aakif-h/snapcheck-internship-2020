# SnapCheck Coding Challenge Solution

This is my final solution for SnapCheck's Coding Challenge. The overall time complexity 
of my solution is still O(N<sup>2</sup>), but the space complexity has been improved
significantly, down to O(1). This was achieved by accessing the final encrypted string's
indices in place, rather than using a matrix buffer.

Two of the mentioned inputs in the ChallengeDescription.md file were tested, and their outputs
have been posted below.
